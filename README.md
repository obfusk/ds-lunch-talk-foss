## Description

  Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) (Licensing): A Crash Course for
  Computer Scientists

  > Millions of people make use of free and open-source software. The
  infrastructure of the internet relies on it, as do the servers of
  large and small organisations. Without FOSS, the internet as we know
  it would not exist. In this talk Felix Stegerman, Deputy Coordinator
  Netherlands of the Free Software Foundation Europe and bachelor
  student CS, will give a quick overview of the history and definition
  of FOSS and its relation to fundamental freedoms, vendor dependence,
  privacy and autonomy. He will discuss its relevance to individuals,
  the public sector, academia, and businesses; including how using
  Free Software in a commercial context relates to business models.
  Felix will point to the differences between the traditional
  "copyleft" and modern popular free software licenses and will
  underline their advantages and disadvantages in a number of use
  cases.
