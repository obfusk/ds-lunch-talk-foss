## History

.large[.nobullets[
  * Before 1980: mostly academic culture
  * 1980 @ MIT AI Lab: new printer w/o source code
  * "Who controls the software?"
]]

![](xerox_9700.png)
]]

.large[.nobullets[
  * GNU/Linux, Firefox, LibreOffice, Apache, VLC, ...
  * Git, Android, ...
]]

???

* Xerox 9700; jammed -&gt; message; freely modify used software
* the computers? our digital lives? Apple? Microsoft? Facebook? etc.
* Free as in Freedom, not Beer (or Lunch)

> Millions of people make use of free and open-source software. The
infrastructure of the internet relies on it, as do the servers of
large and small organisations. Without FOSS, the internet as we know
it would not exist.

## Four Freedoms

.large[.nobullets[
  * 0: to **run** freely, for any purpose
  * 1: to **study** and **adapt** to your needs
  * 2: to **redistribute**, so you can help others
  * 3: to **release improvements**, so everyone benefits
]]

### Open Source

> "Open source is a development methodology; free software is a social
movement."

---

## Security

See "Increased security through open source"
<br/>
by Jaap-Henk Hoepman & Bart Jacobs

## Dependence & Privacy

.large[.nobullets[
  * Fundamental freedoms
  * Puts control in the hands of its users
  * Verify vs trust blindly
  * Autonomy & sovereignty (voting machines, ...)
  * IoT / medical devices
]]

### Kerckhoffs's principle

### Requirement, not a guarantee

???

* why I only use free software
* proponents (like myself) say...
* easy to design system I can't break (see also Roel Verdult)
* no guarantee: heartbleed / resources

---

## Not just for individuals

.large[.nobullets[
  * Terms & conditions; didn't read
  * Not dependent on vendor; can modify; future-proof;
    interoperability; flexibility; localization
  * No Facebook or Twitter w/o FOSS
  * Android, Ruby on Rails, .net, ...
]]

???

* businesses are (juridical) persons too

---

## Business Models

.large[.nobullets[
  * *Adding value* vs paying for license: not charging for the
    software but for services, support, training, customization,
    integration, certification...
]]

### Also

.large[.nobullets[
  * Funding & grants
  * Donation-based funding / crowdfunding
  * Free software w/ proprietary data (e.g. games)
  * Dual licensing / open core / freemium
  * Software as a service
  * Re-licensing
]]

### Customers' rights?

.large[.nobullets[
  * Developing software (e.g. websites, apps) for customers
]]

???

* selling is perfectly legal...
* google sells ads, not software
* redhat (support)
* summer of code / universities / governments
* mysql (dual)
* saas vs. user freedom
* mac os (re-licensing)

---

## Public benefits

.large[.nobullets[
  * Government
  * Public good
  * Generative technology (students!)
  * Open standards
]]

## Motie-Vendrik

## Academia

.large[.nobullets[
  * Sharing knowledge
  * Wider use
  * Reproducibility & verifiability
]]

???

* publicly funded...

## Permissive vs Copyleft

.large[.nobullets[
  * Copyleft - all rights reversed
  * Uses copyright to enforce reciprocity
  * Whose freedom? (developer vs user)
  * Private modifications are OK (modulo AGPL)
]]

.logos[.logos-4[
![](Copyleft.svg)
]]

  * AGPL    ("strong"* copyleft)
]]

.logos[.logos-3[
![](Apache_Software_Foundation_Logo_2016.svg)

  and notification for changes is required.
* MPL allows combining w/ non-MPL files
* AGPL requires source to be made available to network users
